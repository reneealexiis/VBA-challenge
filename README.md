# VBA Challenge Steps Taken 

## Description 
In this challenge, I utilized a for loop to iterate through the data and extract the required information as outlined in the assignment. I implemented a loop to iterate through and execute the same script in every worksheet within the document. By leveraging the Xpert Learning Assistant, I was able to develop VBA scripts and subsequently refined them to ensure precision.
Throughout the challenge, I successfully identified the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease, and total stock volume for each of the datasets provided. This process involved thorough data analysis and manipulation using VBA scripting techniques.
